Function of JUMPp is to pre-process mass spectrometer generated raw data for protein identification and quantificaiton
JUMPp composes of 4 segments: 

i. JUMPps: Protein database search; 
ii. JUMPpf: Putative Match filtering using a target-decoy strategy.
iii. JUMPpl: Phosphosite site localization score calculation for phosphoproteome analysis. 
iv. JUMPpg: protein/peptide quantification for TMT labelling

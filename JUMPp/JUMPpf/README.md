# HGG_Source_Code_JUMPpf 
The function of JUMPp is to filter experimental MS spetrum and theoretical spectrum from proteome database using target-decoy strategy. 
The method was published in our previous article: Li Y. et, al. JUMPg: an integrative proteogenomics pipeline identifying unannotated proteins in human brain and cancer cells. JPR.2016: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00344
The source code was published as one of the components of JUMPg at: https://github.com/liyuxin-bioinformatics/JUMPg

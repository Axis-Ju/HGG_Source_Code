# HGG_Source_Code_JUMPpq
JUMP -q is a multiplexed peptide/protein quantification tool which measures the relative abundances of peptides/proteins in samples (up to 11 different samples) labeled with tandom mass tag (TMT) reagents at the same time. It also provides statistical analysis of peptide/protein abundances to facilitate the identification of differentially expressed molecules across experimental conditions. JUMP -q includes some useful features such as impurity correction of TMT reporters, normalization between samples to remove loading-biases and interference removal of TMT quantification data (1).
JUMP -q is writtin in Perl and runs on the command line under Linux.

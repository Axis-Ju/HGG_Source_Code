# HGG_Source_Code_JUMPps

JUMPps is a new hybrid database search algorithm that generates amino acid tags and ranks peptide spectrum matches by the tags and pattern matching. JUMP can use all potential sequence tags, as short as only one amino acid, in database search. Thus JUMP has high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate true matches from false matches. The program also provides additional features, such as (i) identification of co-eluted peptides from mixture MS/MS spectra, and (ii) assignment of modification sites by tags. The current version is optimized for the analysis of high resolution MS/MS spectra. The program is written in perl and is designed for high performance parallel computing systems.

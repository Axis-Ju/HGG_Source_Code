# HGG_Source_Code for JUMPn
Function of JUMPn is for network analysis of proteomics-centered multi-omics data.
JUMPn composes of 5 segments:

i. Proteome co-expression clustering analysis using WGCNA: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WGCNA/index.html
ii.Pathway enrichment of each co-expression clusters using Fisher's exact test
iii. Kinase activity reference using IKAP:https://omictools.com/ikap-tool
iv. transcriptional factor activity reference using target gene expression
v. Pathway activity calculation

DATASET_SIMPLEBAR
#In simple bar charts, each ID is associated to a single numeric value which is displayed as a bar outside the tree.
#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#                    MANDATORY SETTINGS                           #
#=================================================================#
#select the separator which is used to delimit the data below (TAB,SPACE or COMMA).This separator must be used throughout this file (except in the SEPARATOR line, which uses space).
#SEPARATOR TAB
#SEPARATOR SPACE
SEPARATOR COMMA

#label is used in the legend table (can be changed later)
DATASET_LABEL,PDGFRAvsCNTRL_UPREG 1

#dataset color (can be changed later)
COLOR,#ff0000

#                    OPTIONAL SETTINGS                            #
#=================================================================#
#dataset scale: you can simply set the values where the scale will be drawn
#DATASET_SCALE,2000,10000,20000
#or you can specify value, label and color for each scale line (dash separated, format: VALUE-LABEL-COLOR) 
#DATASET_SCALE,2000-2k line-#0000ff,10000-line at 10k-#ff0000,20000

#each dataset can have a legend, which is defined below
#for each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label
#shape should be a number between 1 and 5:
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle

#maximum width
#WIDTH,1000

#left margin, used to increase/decrease the spacing to the next dataset. Can be negative, causing datasets to overlap.
#MARGIN,0

#always show internal values; if set, values associated to internal nodes will be displayed even if these nodes are not collapsed. It could cause overlapping in the dataset display.
#SHOW_INTERNAL,0

#bar height factor; Default bar height will be slightly less than the available space between leaves, but you can set a multiplication factor here to increase/decrease it (values from 0 to 1 will decrease it, values above 1 will increase it)
#HEIGHT_FACTOR,1

#Bars are aligned to the node lines by default. Using BAR_SHIFT, you can move them all up/down by a fixed amount
#BAR_SHIFT,0

#BAR_ZERO specifies which dataset value will be used as a starting point for drawing the bars. Dataset values smaller than BAR_ZERO will be displayed to the left (possibly overlapping the tree, unless MARGIN is increased)
#BAR_ZERO,0

#Internal tree nodes can be specified using IDs directly, or using the 'last common ancestor' method described in iTOL help pages

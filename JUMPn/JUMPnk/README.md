Kinase activity analysis was carried out using IKAP,a heuristic machine learning algorithm to infer kinase activities from the related substrate phosphorylation levels. 
Kinase-substrate relationship was extracted from the PhosphoSitePlus database. The level of substrate phosphorylation may be attributed to the related kinase activates and the abundance of substrate itself. 
To eliminate the effect of substrate abundance, the phosphoproteome data were normalized against the whole proteome level.
